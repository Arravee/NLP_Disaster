# NLP_Disaster


## Jupyter Notebook
Please note that this notebook was run in Google Colab Pro. If you are running this on your home machine without GPU workload enabled for tensorflow you will experience significantly longer runtimes for the construction of the models. 

## Dataset
The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview. The notebook directly downloads the dataset using the Kaggle API. If you wish to instead download the dataset first through the link and not the API please remember to comment out the terminal commands. 

## Screenshot
A screenshot of the placing of the best model from this code can be found here.
